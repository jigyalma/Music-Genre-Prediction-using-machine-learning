                        <h3>Different features used to determine the genre of the song</h3>
                        <div class="post-info"><span>Popularity</span></div>
                        <p> This will determine the popularity of the song.</p>
                
                        <div class="post-info"><span>Acousticness</span></div>
                        <p> Songs with higher acousticness are more likely to use acoustic and non-electronic
                            instruments. Acousticness is measured on a scale of 0 (not acoustic) to 100 (very
                            acoustic). Acoustic and non-electronic instruments are more likely to be used in songs with a
                            higher acousticness. The second subplot demonstrates that the majority of songs
                            and music pieces are not acoustic.</p>
                

                            <div class="post-info"><span>Danceability</span></div>
                            <p> The danceability of a track is determined by a combination of musical elements such
                                as tempo, rhythm, and beat. Songs with a higher danceability have more consistent
                                and stronger beats. Danceability, like acousticness, is measured on a scale of 0 (low
                                danceability) to 100 (high danceability) (high danceability).</p>
                
                                <div class="post-info"><span>Duration ms</span></div>
                                <p> Music duration is given in milliseconds. Most samples are not longer than 0.3e6
                                    (300 000) milliseconds, or 300 seconds, or exactly 5 minutes. Sounds reasonable.</p>
                        
                                <div class="post-info"><span>Energy</span></div>
                                <p> The perceived intensity and activity of a song is measured by energy. Energy is also
                                measured on a scale of 0 (low energy) to 100 (high energy) (high energy). Higher
                                energy songs are more intense, dynamic, and loud.</p>
                
                                <div class="post-info"><span>Instrumentalness</span></div>
                                <p> The presence of vocals in a track is predicted by its instrumentality. The level of
                                    instrumentality is scaled from 0 (probably contains vocal content) to 100. (likely
                                    contains no vocal content). Instrumental songs are less likely to contain vocals.</p>

                                
                                <div class="post-image" style="background-image:url(&quot;../static/assets/img/guitar.jpg&quot;);"></div>


                                <div class="post-info"><span>Key</span></div>
                                <p> In classical, Western art, and Western pop music, the key of a piece is the group of
                                    pitches, or scale, that serves as the foundation of a musical composition.
                                    </p>
                
                                <div class="post-info"><span>Liveness</span></div>
                                    <p>The presence of an audience in a song is detected by liveness. The level of liveness is
                                    scaled from 0 (no audience) to 100. (audible audience). Songs with a higher liveness
                                    have a higher chance of being performed live.</p>
                
                                <div class="post-info"><span>Loudness</span></div>
                                    <p> The decibel level of a song is measured by loudness. Because decibels are relative
                                        to a reference value, songs with lower loudness values are quieter than songs with
                                        higher loudness values. </p>
                
                                <div class="post-info"><span>Speechiness</span></div>
                                <p>The presence of spoken words in a song is measured by speechiness. Speechiness is
                                    measured on a scale of 0 (low speechiness) to 100 (high speechiness) (high speechiness). Songs with a higher level of speechiness are mostly made up of spoken words,
                                    similar to poetry or a talk show.</p>
                
                                <div class="post-info"><span>Tempo</span></div>
                                <p> The tempo of a song is measured in beats per minute (bpm). Many popular songs
                                    have tempos ranging from 50 to 200 beats per minute. Songs with a higher tempo
                                    move faster. </p>

                                <div class="post-info"><span>Valence</span></div>
                                    <p>Valence assesses a song’s positivity. Valence is measured on a scale of 0 (low valence)
                                        to 100 (high valence) (high valence). Higher valence songs sound happier and more
                                        cheerful.</p>
